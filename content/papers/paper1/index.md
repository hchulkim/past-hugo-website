##### Abstract

We adopt the methodology proposed by Lee, Lee and Lin (2021) to estimate the migration attractiveness of Korean cities using internal migration data. Our approach has two advantages over traditional methods. First, it is cost-effective as it uses pre-existing administrative data, unlike surveys. Second, It also gives a more comprehensive view of city's viability by accounting for migration costs and patterns. Our findings confirm the ongoing regional imbalance and indicate that some rural areas' migration attractiveness are lower than what their population growth suggests.
